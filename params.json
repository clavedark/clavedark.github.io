{"name":"Dave Clark","tagline":"Department of Political Science, Binghamton University","body":"I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Political Science](https://www.binghamton.edu/political-science/)  at [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu/). \r\n \r\nMy research has to do with the causes of international conflict, especially the strategic sources of foreign policy choice. I'm working on projects dealing with state resources and foreign policy choices, on experimental evaluation of bargaining models, and on citizens' decisions to mobilize in protest of the state. My recent work is supported by the National Science Foundation, and by the Political Instability Task Force. I teach courses in international relations, sources of conflict, and in statistical methods. \r\n\r\nYou can find my [current CV here](https://github.com/clavedark/clavedark.github.io/clarkcv.pdf).\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Data Collections**\r\n\r\nMass Mobilization Data Project (sponsored by the Political Instability Task Force)\r\n* [Mass Mobilization Project Website](http://www.binghamton.edu/massmobilization)\r\n* [Mass Mobilization Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/MMdata)\r\n\r\nInstitutions and Elections Project (sponsored by the Political Instability Task Force)\r\n* [IAEP Website](https://www.binghamton.edu/political-science/institutions-and-elections-project.html)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Selected papers: **\r\n\r\n\r\n Sieberg, K., Clark, D.H., Holt, C., Nordstrom, T., and Reed, W.
