      <section>
        <p>I am a Professor in the <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/political-science/">Department of Political Science</a> 
at <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/">Binghamton University</a>, and Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies in Harpur College of Arts and Sciences.


My research considers sources of political instability, and particular focuses on political protests, how and why citizens mobilize against the state, and how governments react to those protests. My recent work is supported by the Political Instability Task Force. I also study the causes of international conflict, especially the strategic sources of foreign policy. Additionally, I study interstate bargaining and work on experimental evaluation of bargaining models where conflict is the outside option.

I teach courses on political violence and statistical methods.
